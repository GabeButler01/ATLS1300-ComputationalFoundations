# Week 3 and PC03 Content
Practice code to learn about lists, tuples & ranges, start code for PC03, and snippets of cool spirograph code!
<br>
<br>
Download these files in order to get a fast start to your Programming Challenge. In this folder you'll find:
<br><b>     1. PC03 start code</b>- Imports turtle and math, creates a window for you!
<br><b>     2. Spirograph code</b>- Contains a bit of code that draws a square and circle spirograph. <b>READ THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE FILE BEFORE USING.</b>
<br><b>     3. In-class code (2)</b>- Contains activities and example code we'll biuld in class with detailed comments, for review/help.
<br>
<br>
For this assignment, you'll use the turtle library to create a unique, still image background for Zoom! Because we all still use Zoom...right?

You may use any aspect of the Turtle library you like, and you may explore others' code when you create your piece.

Note: You do NOT have to use parametric equations or spirographs in this assignment...I just think they're fun.

### For full credit, you must:
1. Use a screen that has width = 600 pixels and height = 600 pixels. (HINT: What would you change in the start code?)
2. Use at least 4 colors, 1 of them must be RGB.
3. Use at least 2 different shapes (line, circle, stamp, dot, etc..)
4. Use the ```turtle.goto()``` function at least once.
5. Use ```turtle.up()``` and ```turtle.down()``` at least once (each).

### Submission:
1. Your pseudocode (image of doc, or .docx, .rtf, .txt), by the **end of recitation**. 
2. A [screenshot](https://www.pcmag.com/news/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-any-device) of your finished image (.png, .jpeg) with naming format: PC03_YOURNAME.jpg
3. Your .py file, with saving format:  **PC03_Zoom.py**
4. Submit your code (.py) to this repository. Submit your image and pseudocode on here or Canvas, whatever is easier for you (submitting in multiple places is OK).
To submit to this repository, simply click the **Add File** button at the top of the list of documents. Then, drag and drop your file(s) into the window. You may also browse and select your files.

### Tools
- Use the starter code (Turtle_start.py) to set up this assignment like others we've done in class. You do not have to cite this code!
- Here's a [cheat sheet](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwib9JbG5qfrAhWEUs0KHfruAXMQFjAAegQIBRAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.computingatschool.org.uk%2Ffiles%2F8116%2Foriginal.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0GdUjgGdiuwtjjDgEjzd9C) (pdf) to help you remember the functions, and an [intro to turtle](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwib9JbG5qfrAhWEUs0KHfruAXMQFjAEegQIBhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Frealpython.com%2Fbeginners-guide-python-turtle%2F&usg=AOvVaw3pHGqJn6GGaumCRv6kK96c) to help refresh how it all works together.
- Here is [example code](https://github.com/ATLS1300/Example-code/blob/master/Turtle_shapes.py) from the class on how to draw different shapes.
- Want help choosing a color theme? Try [coolors.co](https://coolors.co). (Tutorial will pop up when you go there.)


### Extra credit (Grads must complete 2 of 3): 

0.25 pts - Submit a screenshot of you in front of your background 

0.5 pt - Use a for loop and range() to make a sweet pattern!

1 pt - Try a [parametric pattern](https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/75648/pages/parametric-patterns)!
